            Welcome to Clever Fox, a 2D learning game designed for kids by a
            team of eight developers. This captivating game features a
            collection of engaging mini-games carefully crafted to provide
            valuable learning experiences. With an upcoming preschool teacher as
            a stakeholder, we've tailored these games to cater to young
            learners' needs and abilities. In Clever Fox, children can explore
            various mini-games, each offering a unique educational adventure.

            They can dress the fox according to real-time weather conditions,
            thanks to a weather API that provides accurate weather data based on
            their location. The memory game challenges them with adorable
            animal-themed pairs, while math games enhance their problem-solving
            skills. Additionally, kids can expand their vocabulary by matching
            words and letters in an interactive way. To add a touch of
            creativity, "Musik med r√§ven" lets young composers craft their own
            melodies. Clever Fox offers a playful and enriching journey for kids
            to learn and have fun simultaneously.
