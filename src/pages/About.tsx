            I have 5+ years of experience working with game development through
            school and personal projects, and I have more than a year of
            hands-on experience in my current role. I have experience working
            with the Unity game engine, am proficient in C#, and have a strong
            foundation in Java, Mobile Development, Python, HTML, and coding
            principles like OOP and SOLID. I've hunted and fixed bugs,
            refactored code, and optimized projects for both Android and iOS.

            I'm a driven go-getter who knows how to get things done and
            prioritize tasks. I always enjoy learning new skills and techniques,
            and solving challenging problems with my team always gives me a
            dopamine rush. Outside work hours, I like to test out various game
            development techniques and watch tutorials to expand my knowledge.
